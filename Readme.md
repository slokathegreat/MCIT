### Task Overview: Developing a Question Answering Model

The goal of this project is to develop a robust question-answering model utilizing the ARCD dataset. The approach involves exploring and implementing multiple techniques to enhance the model's performance.

### Techniques Employed:

1. **Classical Machine Learning**  
   Initial efforts involve leveraging traditional machine learning methods to establish a baseline performance for the question-answering task.

2. **Fine-Tuning a Transformer**  
   Advanced techniques include fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model, adapting it specifically to the nuances of the ARCD dataset for improved accuracy.

3. **Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**  
   The final phase focuses on constructing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to provide more contextually accurate answers.
