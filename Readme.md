### Task Overview: Developing a Question Answering Model

The goal of this project is to develop a robust question-answering model utilizing the ARCD dataset. The approach involves exploring and implementing multiple techniques to enhance the model's performance.

### Techniques Employed:

1. **Classical Machine Learning**  
   Initial efforts involve leveraging traditional machine learning methods to establish a baseline performance for the question-answering task.

2. **Fine-Tuning a Transformer**  
   Advanced techniques include fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model, adapting it specifically to the nuances of the ARCD dataset for improved accuracy.

3. **Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**  
   The final phase focuses on constructing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to provide more contextually accurate answers.

## Data Cleaning
- **Text Normalization**: Remove or standardize text elements such as punctuation and special characters, and convert text to a consistent case (e.g., all lowercase).
- **Tokenization**: Split text into smaller units, such as words or phrases, to facilitate further analysis.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminate common words (e.g., "and", "the") that don’t add significant meaning to the text.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., converting "running" to "run") to treat different forms of a word as the same.

## TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: Convert text data into numerical features by evaluating the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.
  - **Term Frequency (TF)**: Count the occurrences of each term in a document.
  - **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Assess the importance of a term by considering its frequency across all documents. Terms that appear frequently in many documents are given lower weights.

## Linear Regression Model
- **Multi-output Regression**: Predict multiple outputs simultaneously, which could include various aspects of an answer (e.g., relevance score, answer span).
- **Scalability**: While linear regression is straightforward and easy to implement, it might not be suitable for large-scale or complex datasets due to its limitations in capturing non-linear relationships and dependencies.

## Building and Evaluating the Model
- **Model Training**: Fit the linear regression model to the TF-IDF features extracted from the cleaned data.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to gauge how well it predicts the answers.

This classical approach provides a solid foundation and baseline performance, which can be further enhanced with more advanced techniques like fine-tuning transformers and developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
