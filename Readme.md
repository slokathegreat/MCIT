### Task Overview: Developing a Question Answering Model

The goal of this project is to develop a robust question-answering model utilizing the ARCD dataset. The approach involves exploring and implementing multiple techniques to enhance the model's performance.

### Techniques Employed:

1. **Classical Machine Learning**  
   Initial efforts involve leveraging traditional machine learning methods to establish a baseline performance for the question-answering task.

2. **Fine-Tuning a Transformer**  
   Advanced techniques include fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model, adapting it specifically to the nuances of the ARCD dataset for improved accuracy.

3. **Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**  
   The final phase focuses on constructing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to provide more contextually accurate answers.

## Data Cleaning
- **Text Normalization**: Remove or standardize text elements such as punctuation and special characters.
- **Tokenization**: Split text into smaller units, such as words or phrases, to facilitate further analysis.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminate common words (e.g., "هذا", "الذى") that don’t add significant meaning to the text.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., converting "يحب" to "حب") to treat different forms of a word as the same.

## TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: Convert text data into numerical features by evaluating the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.
  - **Term Frequency (TF)**: Count the occurrences of each term in a document.
  - **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Assess the importance of a term by considering its frequency across all documents. Terms that appear frequently in many documents are given lower weights.


This classical approach provides a solid foundation and baseline performance, which can be further enhanced with more advanced techniques like fine-tuning transformers and developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
# Fine-Tuning the `arabi-elidrisi/ArabicDistilBERT_QA` Model (Accuracy 82%)
![Screenshot from 2024-08-10 01-13-47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6886e332-2b28-4343-b1dc-c5a5a42e53d2)

The `arabi-elidrisi/ArabicDistilBERT_QA` model, a fine-tuned version of DistilBERT for Arabic, achieved an accuracy of 82%. Here’s a brief overview of the fine-tuning process and some disadvantages:

#### Fine-Tuning Process
1. **Model Selection**: Start with DistilBERT, which has been pre-trained on a large corpus and adapted to handle Arabic text.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Train the model on a specific Arabic question-answering dataset. This involves adjusting the model’s parameters based on the question-answer pairs to specialize in generating accurate answers from the given context.
3. **Evaluation**: After fine-tuning, the model is tested on a validation set to ensure its performance, achieving an accuracy of 82%.

#### Disadvantages
- **Training Time**: Fine-tuning the model can be time-consuming, depending on the size of the dataset and computational resources.
- **Disk Space**: The model, along with its fine-tuned weights, can require significant disk space, which might be a concern for storage and deployment.

# Designg a RAG System

This process optimizes DistilBERT for question-answering in Arabic but comes with the trade-offs of increased training time and disk space usage.

I attempted to train a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system but encountered difficulties due to OpenAI’s rate limits. I explored alternative options, but most were either paid services or required substantial resources to run locally.

### Main Idea of RAG

The core concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is to enhance answer generation by combining two processes:

1. **Retrieval**: It searches a vast database to find relevant information related to a query.
2. **Generation**: It then uses this retrieved information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.

This method integrates the strengths of information retrieval with the flexibility of generative models to provide well-informed answers.
